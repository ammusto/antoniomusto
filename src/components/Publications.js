                <li>Musto, Antonio. “From Trial (<em>Miḥna</em>) to Tribulation (<em>Balāʾ</em>): A New Look at Ghulām Khalīl’s
                    (d. 275/888) Inquisition Against the Sufis,” <em>al-ʿUṣūr al-Wusṭā</em>, 2024</li>
                <li><strong>Abstract</strong>: The execution of al-Ḥallāj (d. 309/922) and Ghulām Khalīl’s (d. 275/888) inquisition (<em>miḥna</em>) against the Sufis have loomed large in the historiography of Sufism. These events are often depicted as instances of anti-Sufi prosecution that fundamentally reshaped Sufism, causing later Sufis to align it more closely with “normative” Islam. While modern scholarship has recently challenged the influence and impact attributed to al-Ḥallāj's fate, this article expands this critical perspective to Ghulām Khalīl’s <em>miḥna</em>, details of which are provided across numerous sources. For the first time, these narratives will be critically examined highlighting problematic aspects that call into question its historicity. More importantly, however, this article looks to the way in which Sufis themselves engaged with and presented this <em>miḥna</em> in texts from the third/ninth century onward. Rather than being something to be answered for or contended with, Sufis offered these narratives as examples of tribulation (<em>balāʾ</em>) and connected them to a wide array of Sufi concepts, including altruism (<em>īthār</em>), forbearance (<em>ṣabr</em>), gratitude (<em>shukr</em>), and contentment with God (<em>riḍā</em>), among other interpretive frames. This article revisits a core element of the historiography of early Sufism and sheds light on the place of tribulation in the “universe of meaning” of early Sufis.</li>

                    418/1027) <em>Shawāhid al-Taṣawwuf</em>,” <em>Journal of Sufi Studies</em>, Winter 2025</li>
                <li><strong>Abstract</strong>:Abū Manṣūr Maʿmar b. Aḥmad al-Iṣfahānī (d. 418/1027), a Ḥanbalī scholar and Sufi, is
                    a relatively neglected figure in the history of Sufism despite his substantial textual
                    output. This article draws renewed attention to Abū Manṣūr by introducing the
                    (re)discovered <em>Shawāhid al-taṣawwuf</em>, a text by Abū Manṣūr previously believed to be
                    lost. Preserved in a single manuscript held at the Dār al-Kutub al-Miṣriyya,
                    the <em>Shawāhid al-taṣawwuf</em> is a multigeneric text. It is at once a treatise of Sufism, a
                    biographical dictionary of Sufi shaykhs, and an autobiographical narrative of Abū
                    Manṣūr’s own travels to meet Sufi masters. Beyond offering new insights into Abū
                    Manṣūr’s engagement with Sufism, the <em>Shawāhid</em> sheds new light on the social history
                    of Sufism during the fourth/tenth century, revealing previously unknown figures and
                    initiatic chains. An edition of the <em>Shawāhid</em>, edited by the author of the current article, is
                    forthcoming.</li>

                <li>Musto, Antonio. “An Early Argument for One God: Two Excerpts from al-Ḥārith b. Asad al-Muḥāsibī ’s (d. 243/857) <em>Kitāb al-ʿAẓama and al-Tanbīh ʿalā Aʿmāl al-Qulūb</em>,” <em>Journal of
                    Islamic Studies</em></li>
                <li><strong>Abstract</strong>: Al-Ḥārith b. Asad al-Muḥāsibī (d. 243/857) is primarily recognized as an early precursor to Sufism,
                    but his role as a theologian using kalām-style argumentation against the rationalist Muʿtazila has received less attention.
                    As a contemporary of key Muʿtazilite figures in third/ninth century Baghdād, al-Muḥāsibī's theological works,
                    particularly <em>Kitāb al-ʿAẓama</em> and <em>Kitāb al-Tanbīh ʿalā aʿmāl al-qulūb</em>, offer significant insights into the intellectual discourse of his time.
                    These texts provide early examples of what would later be known as the proof of mutual hindrance (<em>dalīl al-tamānuʿ</em>), though he does not use the term.
                    This article explores these works, placing al-Muḥāsibī within the broader theological context of the period
                    and examining the history of <em>dalīl al-tamānuʿ</em> as used by Muslims, Christians, and Jews.
                    It also analyzes the manuscripts' content, highlighting al-Muḥāsibī’s synthesis of kalām terminology, contemplative elements, and Greek philosophical influences.
                    The article revisits Josef van Ess’s categorization of al-Muḥāsibī’s theological proofs,
                    noting overlaps between mutual hindrance and teleological proofs.
                    Finally, it includes the edited Arabic text of both excerpts.</li>

                <li>The <em>Karāmāt Abī ʿAlī al-Qūmsānī</em>: Spiritual Legacy, the Miraculous, and the Everyday Part I and Part II</li>
                <li><strong>Abstract:</strong> This two-part article looks at the  Ṣūfī Shaykh Abū ʿAlī al-Qūmsānī and the Sufi community of Hamadhān to which he belonged.
                    The first article first recreates this Hamadhānī community, centering three of its most well-known Ṣūfī shaykhs from the fourth/tenth and fifth/eleventh centuries,
                    Abū ʿAlī al-Qūmsānī, Jaʿfar al-Abharī, and Ṭāhir al-Jaṣṣāṣ. Attention is then turned to the family of Abū ʿAlī, especially his grandson Ibn Zayrak and his works
                    <em>Karāmāt Abī ʿAlī al-Qūmsānī</em>, which contains forty-seven anecdotes about Abū ʿAlī and his life, including an Arabic edition of the text. The second article explores
                    the text in more detail, engaging not only with the content of the text, but raising historiographical questions about the genre of hagiography. This article treats a
                    variety of topics in everyday life, including familial relations, the place of dreams, and the social role of the Sufi shaykh. Finally, this second article includes a
                    translation of the treatise.</li>

                <li>Between Legend and Text: Commentaries on the sayings of Bābā Ṭāhir al-Jaṣṣāṣ al-Hamadhānī</li>
                <li><strong>Abstract:</strong> There is a significant tradition of commentaries on sayings attributed to the poet Bābā Ṭāhir al-ʿUryān, whose poetry had captivated Orientalist scholars since the nineteenth century. Studies of Bābā Ṭāhir have continued, especially among Persian scholars, including three monograph-length studies in the second half of the twentieth centuries. The semi-legendary status of Bābā Ṭāhir has rendered any historical study of his life difficult due to a paucity of biographical material or details. More recently, Nasrollah Pourjavady has argued that Bābā Ṭāhir al-ʿUryān is, in fact, Ṭāhir b. Muḥammad al-Jaṣṣās al-Hamadhānī (d. 418), a famous shaykh of the Jibāl region. This claim, however, has renewed scholarly debate about the identity of Bābā Ṭāhir, engendering critical responses and additional scholarship on this issue. This article is a look at the historical Ṭāhir al-Jaṣṣās, including his place within the Sufi communities of the Jibāl, the textual legacy of the commentaries attributed to Bābā Ṭāhir al-Hamadhānī, and the Arabic text of an unpublished collection of these sayings from MS Arabe 1903 held in the Bibliotheque National de France.</li>

                <li>Edition of Abū Manṣūr al-Iṣfahānī's <em>Sawāhid al-taṣawwuf</em></li>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> I am currently in the process of editing the unpublished and previously thought lost <em>Sawāhid al-taṣawwuf</em> by Abū Manṣūr al-Iṣfahānī (d. 418).
                    I have a forthcoming article about the text, but it is a multigeneric work, part Sufi treatise, part biographical dictionary, and part autobiographical. The text provides new
                    and exciting insights into the formative period of Sufism.</li>
